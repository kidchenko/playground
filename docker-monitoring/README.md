[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/vegasbrianc/docker-monitoring.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vegasbrianc/docker-monitoring)

After publishing the article for Docker Monitoring based on cAdvisor, InfluxDB, and Grafana the request came up to share the Grafana Dashboards that were referenced in the article - [Docker Monitoring Article](https://www.brianchristner.io/how-to-setup-docker-monitoring/)

Please take a look a the Docker-Monitoring-xx.json file to view the Grafana Dashboard's json file and check out the queries folders for screenshots of the queries in each graph.

Also added the docker-compose.yml file to easily stand up the entire Monitoring Stack.
