# Delphi port of the Gilded-Rose Kata
This is a Delphi port of the *Gilded-Rose-Kata*.

## Version Compatibility
The project files are written in Delphi 10.3.3 therefore require 10.3 or later.
That said, the actual code should be compatible back to Delphi 2010 as the unit
tests are written in [DUnitX](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX) which
requires Delphi 2010 or later.

## Building and Running
* Open the project group `GildedRose.groupproj`.
* Build and run the `TextTestFixture.exe` for the text output tests.
* Build and run the `UnitTests.exe` project to execute the unit tests.
