# Linq Up #

An exercise in changing code to use LINQ.
This sample code doing some operations on a collection without using LINQ. You can refactor this to make use of LINQ.

The part to refactor is in the `Group` class

As extra challenge there is an additional class `CharacterFrequencyCounter` that can be rewritten using LINQ as well.

Good luck.netcoreapp3.0

## Running the sample ##

The code is in a class library. It is covered by a test library using Xunit. Run using `dotnet test` from the `LinqUp.Core.Tests` directory.

The application targets netcoreapp3.0 and uses C# 8. In addition Nullable reference types have been enabled.
