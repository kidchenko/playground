# DEPLOYING A PROXY API

API Gateway can proxy all requests directly to a Lambda function, making it easy to wire up complex integrations. This is a good alternative to using claudia-api-builder if you want to process all request information and routing yourself, or if you want to pass it on to a third-party module that provides routing (such as an express server, for example).

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to create and deploy a simple proxy API. Make sure you use Claudia.js version 2.0 or later.
