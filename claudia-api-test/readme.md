# HELLO WORLD FROM API GATEWAY

This is a step-by-step guide for creating a simple serverless Web API using Lambda and API Gateway, and deploying it to AWS using Claudia.js. AWS Lambda is an event-driven compute service, that executes your code in reaction to various events. API Gateway is a HTTPS end-point that can receive requests and pass them on to Lambda. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll connect them together to execute simple requests.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to IAM, Lambda and API Gateway
