<#
This is a typical procedural PowerShell script. It is used to "sync" a number of employees stored in a CSV file
to Active Directory. This mimics a typical script you might use in your
daily work life. You've got a set of requirements like HR handing you a CSV and saying they need that information
populated in Active Directory. They have an initial set of requirements. 

This script:

 - Attempts to find a corresponding AD account based on the FirstName/LastName of a CSV
 - If found, it skips. If not, it creates a user based on attribute in that CSV row
 - It adds the user account to a departmental group
 - It also disables any user NOT in the CSV
