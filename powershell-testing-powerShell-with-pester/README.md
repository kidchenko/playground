# PowerShell Testing with Pester

## Module 1 - Getting Started

Pester uses TestDrive

TestDrive is just a other powershell drive that is created when a test start.

The TestDrive does not exist outside a test block

The TestDrive is perfect ðŸ‘Œ when you work with files.

The BeforeAll, AfterAll statmemt works using try, catch, finally, block. The BeforeAll is in the start of the try, and the AfterAll is the finally block.

In gereral you have a function called Test-Foo and a `Describe "Test-Foo"` and each it test a different behaviour of the function

You can use `psedit` to open a PowerShell file

## Module 2 - Mocking
